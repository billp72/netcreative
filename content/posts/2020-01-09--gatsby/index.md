**CMS** - Content Management System<br />
**SEO** - Search Engine Optimization<br />
**Hosting** - a company owning servers that connects your website to the internet<br />
**Domain** - the address where your website lives on the server: www.example.com

### WHAT IS GATSBY?
Put simply, Gatsby is a static site generator and modern, Javascript alternative to sites like Wordpress. Along with Gatsby, I also use Contentful as the CMS and Netlify to host my sites. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### WHY SHOULD PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT GATSBY?
Wordpress has dominated the CMS market for a long time. But with advancements in Javascript, I feel Wordpress is due for some competition. I also feel Gatsby is a superior platform in many ways. [Gatsby Starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2)

### WHY SHOULD I USE A SEPERATE CMS?
Contenful is well suited for gatsby since it allows you to manage data outside of the file system. Moreover, when you rely on one platform for both page creation and content management, ala Wordpress, you're locking yourself into that platform. Switching now becomes an arduous process of migrating your data to a new platform if you ever decide to change. Keeping your content in the cloud means you never have to worry about it.

### WHAT ABOUT PERFORMANCE?
According to benchmark testing, Gatsby outperforms Wordpress and other platforms when page load times were compared.

### WHAT ABOUT SEO?
Without getting too technical, Gatsby renders plain HTML to the browser which is accurately indexed by web crawlers. All things being equal, there's no reason a Gatsby site shouldn't rank similar to a Wordpress site on Google. I might even give a slight edge to Gatsby simply for its speed.

### WHAT KINDS OF SITES ARE BEST SUITED FOR GATSBY?
Gatsby is ideal for sites where social sharing is important. This includes, but is not limited to, e-commerce, blogs and marketing sites. Gatsby is not ideal for apps where lots of dynamic content is involved. This includes, but is also not limited to, real-time trading apps and games. Moreover, if it necessary for users to log in to see the majority of their content, Gatsby may not be the best tool for the job. (See server-side rendering for a more flexible solution).

### WHAT ARE THE DOWNSIDES?
Tools like Wordpress are far easier for a layman to use. Gatsby, on the other hand, probably needs to be developed by a developer. And if the goal is to get a website up yourself, and you're not particularly technical, you might want to try Wix. 

*With the speed of change on the internet being what it is, I'm confident drag-n-drop-style, Gatsby - or other static - tools will soon be available. maybe they already are??.*
