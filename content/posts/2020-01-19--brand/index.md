## A few ways to gain trust in the digital era.
 **(1)** Prominently letting your customers know about your return policy or any shipping deals going on engenders trust. **(2)** Providing customers a quick way to chat with a sales agent is another way to start building trust. Unfortunately, no one, especially not large companies, want to handle basic questions anymore. Luckily, chatbots are available to assume tier 1 support at a price even small businesses can afford. Other conveniences, like **(3)** offering a variety of payment methods, e.g., Google Pay, prevents dropped carts and gets repeat business. Finally, and not to be underestimated, **(4)** making it obvious you want new customers to join your mailing list is oddly still very important. (Seriously. Stick a dialog box directly in their faces). Despite all the ways we communicate online, email is still the #1 way to stay connected with your audience.
