## If you build it, they will come
Dollar Shave Club could have built a trusted brand but instead decided to sell the company to Unilever, who already had a trusted brand and other things going for them, for 1 billon dollars. There was nothing proprietary about what DSC was doing. To keep ahead of the copycats, DSC flooded the market with slick advertising thereby gaining instant credibility.

## A few ways to gain trust in the digital era.
While not as sexy as blowing your brand up with expensive advertising then receiving a massive offer, growing your brand slowly using simple strategies to gain trust may accomplish the same thing. Subtly letting your customers know of your return policy and any shipping deals going on globally on the site builds trust. Providing customers a quick way to chat with a sales agent is another way to start building trust. If you're a solo entrepreneur you may not be able to field all questions in a timely manner. Luckily, chatbots are available to assume tier 1 support in your absence. Other conveniences, like offering a variety of payment methods, like Google Pay, prevents dropped carts and gets repeat business. Finally, and not to be underestimated, make it obvious you want new users to join your mailing list. Despite all the other ways we communicate online, email is still #1 and the best way to stay connected with your customers. If you can build trust using technology you can build, if not a brand, an efficient sales machine.

Mirroring the customer service model of brick-and-mortar stores online is the next step in the evolution of web-based stores and one more nail in the coffin for traditional retailers. The opportunity to serve the customer in an online store will soon exceed even the most well-run brick-and-mortar.
