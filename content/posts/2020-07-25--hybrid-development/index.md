**What is the difference between a Webapp and a hybrid app?**

A hybrid app is simply a type of cross-platform app that's developed using a common language for all platforms. A web app is a type of hybrid that's built using javascript, and html but mimics the functionality of a native application. The advantage of hybrid development in general is speed to market.

**What is a native app**

A native app is developed for a single device, like an iPhone and cannot be deployed anywhere else. These apps perform the best since they are written in the operating system language of the device itself.

**Advantages of going native**

Native apps tend to be more predictable in terms of UI and UX (user experience) and are more performant, especially when computation is intense. For some types of applications (like games) and for some companies, there's no substitute for native performance and user experience. 

**Advantages of hybrid development**

Speed of development for the greatest number of platforms is dramatically increased and availablitity of skilled developers is generally higher, as well. Moreover, maintenance costs across all platforms is lower since updates and fixes can be accomplished from a single codebase by a small development team

Things you should consider before deciding on an app type.

<ul>
    <li>How important is native performance and having the perfect native user experience to the success of your app?</li>
    <li>How important is it that your app be cross-platform i.e., run on all major devices and the web? </li>
    <li>What is your budget and current development team skillset?</li>
</ul>

**Hybrid types and descriptions**

Progressive Web App (PWA) - This style app is most like a traditional website since it runs in the browser and does not activate any native code. The advantage of a PWA is in having a luancher icon installed on the device itself. The app can be launched both from a browser and from an icon on the device which opens it in a browser-like container. Unfortunately, iPhone does not currently allow installations of PWA's. In the absence of a device icon, PWA's can still be opened in iPhone browsers

Webapp - this style app is installed and launched from a device's web container with extended its functionality due to the availablity of native component triggers directly in the javascript. <i>Phonegap and other third-party services enable this cross functionality.</i>

Hybrid bridge application - this style app runs both in the native environment and in a javascript container simultaneously. The two pieces communicate with each other across a bridge which is optimised for performance. Facebook's React Native dominates this space, and, in my opinion, is one of the best options that balances performance with speed-to-market I've seen.

Hybrid compiled app - this style app is developed using a common language but compiles completely to native code and is the most performant of the hybrids since no bridge is required. The two companies that currently dominate this space are Microsoft with Xamerin and Google's Flutter. <i>Due to a massive effort by Google, Flutter is gaining lots of traction. Flutter is also a pleasing alternative for React developers since it uses the Reactive programming paradigm</i>

Given the advacements in hybrid technology, I'm amazed at what can be accomplished without sacrificing performance and/or the user experience.
