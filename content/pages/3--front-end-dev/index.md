:coffee: **How many years have you been building websites**
<br />*10 years ago I was a designer - print and some web. Three years after that, I started my developement career* :speech_balloon:

:coffee: **What do you like best about your work?**
<br />*I get a chance to help smaller businesses relize their true potential. Even with all the tools out there, the most difficult website to build is often your own - it can be challenging to be objective when you are passionate about your work or focus when your business is multifaceted. The tempatation, thus, to do too much is great. A redsign with an expert gives the owner a chance to revisit their business model and make significant changes. In this respect, I feel I'm both a business analyst and designer.* :speech_balloon:

:coffee: **What sort of projects have you worked on?**
<br />*Lots of Javascript projects with a smattering of Wordpress as well. PHP 7.4 is out and I've heard good things about it* :speech_balloon:

:coffee: **What technology did you use to build this site?**
<br />*This site uses the [starter-hero-blog](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-hero-blog) theme from Gatsby. Gatsby is the javascript answer to Wordpress for building high-performance sites with app-like features. [Gatsby](https://www.netcreative.org/gatsby)* :speech_balloon:
