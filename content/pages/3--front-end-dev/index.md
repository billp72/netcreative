:coffee: **How many years have you been building websites**
<br />*10 years ago I was a designer - print and some web. Three years after that, I started my developement career* :speech_balloon:

:coffee: **What do you like best about your work?**
<br />*I get a chance to help smaller businesses relize their potential. Even with all the tools out there to self-publish, the most difficult website to build is often your own - it's challenging to be objective when you are passionate about your work or stay focused when your business is multifaceted. The tempatation to do too much is great. A redsign with an expert gives the owner a chance to revisit their business and make significant changes* :speech_balloon: 

:coffee: **What's your approach to working with new clients?**
<br />*When I first meet a client, I usually won't offer anything specific unless they want me to. At this stage, I generally want to know everything I can about the big picture. In this respect, I feel I'm both a business analyst and designer. Ultimately, the key is to be a great listener so you don't end up missing what the customer really wants* :speech_balloon:

:coffee: **What sort of projects have you worked on?**
<br />*Lots of Javascript projects with a smattering of Wordpress as well. PHP 7.4 is out and I've heard good things about it* :speech_balloon:

:coffee: **What technology did you use to build this site?**
<br />*This site uses the [starter-hero-blog](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-hero-blog) theme from Gatsby. Gatsby is the javascript answer to Wordpress for building high-performance sites with app-like features. [Gatsby](https://www.netcreative.org/gatsby)* :speech_balloon:
