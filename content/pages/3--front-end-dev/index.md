Why go with a solo developer?

The number one reason is, service. When you hire an agency, your project may not even be handled by someone in-house, never mind the sales agent on the phone. 

When you hire me, you get me and no one else. There's no delay in getting your questions answered in a timely manner and by the person actually doing the work.
