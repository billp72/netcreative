title: Uber Meets Privacy Policy
---

Rather than bore or confuse you with a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo, we want to explain, in simple terms, how our engineers and product people have gone to great lengths to make Uber Meets safe and secure.
### 1. DATA SECURITY

* Most of the information we store in our Google database is already, apart from sexual orientation, available on your public, Facebook profile. So public images, first name, birthday, and "about" is the only information we capture and store via the Uber Meets app.
* We use OAuth secure sign-in and Google Firebase’s enhanced security rules to keep your data safe and away from hackers wishing to alter or steal it from the Uber Meets app. 

### 2. GPS TRACKING AND OTHER SECURITY
We take your safety extremely seriously. As such, we have included several preventative measures against stalking and other domestic threats. We do this in several ways

* Any attempt to initiate a meeting immediate hides that profile on their map. This will prevent harassment if a meeting request goes unreciprocated.
* If, and for whatever reason, you wish not to be seen by a user, you may remove them from tracking you by clicking “Not Interested” on their profile.
* You can easily remove yourself from being tracked within the app while still using other features like chat. (See the profile page for untracking)
* If you no longer wish to communicate with an individual you were formerly chatting with, you can simply remove them

 Because Uber Meets involves GPS tracking, your exact location will be known by other users you see in the maps area. However, and with the aforementioned security measures in place, we believe our app is no riskier than if you were to go out and attempt to meet someone in a bar, club, or park.

*<small>While Uber Meets will not sell your personal information, reserves the right to change its privacy policy from time to time for any reason</small>*
